ðŸ§  Tic Tac Toe with Unbeatable AI (Python Minimax)
This is a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game where you (the human) play against an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.

ðŸŽ® How It Works
You play as X

The AI plays as O

The AI uses Minimax, a recursive decision-making algorithm, to simulate all possible outcomes and always pick the best move.
